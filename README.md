## Summary

This project is part of the J.P. Morgan Chase Software Engineering Virtual Experience, where 
I worked on the Midas Core system—a backend service responsible for processing, validating, and 
recording financial transactions. The application uses Spring Boot and integrates with Kafka, a 
SQL database, and an external Incentive API. I set up the development environment, added the necessary 
dependencies, and implemented key components to handle transaction flow, including validating users, 
updating balances, and saving records. This simulation demonstrates backend integration skills and real-world 
financial systems experience.
